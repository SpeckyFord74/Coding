    <p>A quote from savewalterwhite.com:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.savewalterwhite.com/">My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I
        found out he was going to die.  That it was going to happen
        soon.  That it was real.  Then I thought about a lot of stuff.
        Things I hadn't thought about for a long time.  I guess I kind
        of took him for granted or something.  I mean, our parents are
        just always there.  You expect them to always be bugging you
        to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or
        try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one
        day.  And make you get up early on the weekend to have
        "family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me
        crazy.  I don't feel that way now.  Everything's different since
        Dad got his diagnosis.  Since I realized that one day in the
        near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.</blockquote>
